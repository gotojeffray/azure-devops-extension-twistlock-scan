# azure-devops-twistcli-tasks
Azure DevOps build and release tasks to perform container image scanning using twistcli.

The extension currently assumes that the twistcli tool is present. You can use a separate task (e.g. Universal Package download) to download it into your Azure DevOps Pipeline. That way you can use this same extension with different versions of `twistlci`. The `twistcli` version must match the Console version.

To build the extension from source, run this command from this directory:

```
From within the "sample-code/CI/Azure_Devops/Extensions/azure-devops-twistcli-tasks" directory, execute:

1. npm install
2. npm run build
```

The output will be a `.vsix` file.
